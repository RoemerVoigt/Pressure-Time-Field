## 🔬 What is the Pressure-Time Field?

The **Pressure-Time Field (PTF)** is a physical model proposing that time, space, and motion emerge from a deeper oscillating pressure field. The model introduces **spiral structure**, **axial time**, and **field-based resonance** as the foundation of observed physical phenomena – from gravitational redshift to biological structure formation.
