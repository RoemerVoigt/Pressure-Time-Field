## 🔬 What is the Pressure-Time Field?

The **Pressure-Time Field (PTF)** is a proposed physical model that redefines space, time, and motion as emergent properties of an underlying pressure-based field. Instead of treating time as linear or absolute, PTF introduces **axial time**, **field rhythm**, and **spiral dynamics** as the source of observed structure and causality.

## 🔍 Why This Matters

The PTF model aims to:
- Offer a unified explanation for observed physical and biological structure.
- Bridge quantum theory, general relativity, and biological systems through a single field framework.
- Provide a **testable alternative** to conventional physics models based on rhythmic field variations.

It introduces novel predictions such as:
- **Field-based explanation of gravitational redshift**
- **Spiral resonance as a basis for energy-mass relationships**
- **Biological resonance patterns explained via field noise and absorption**
