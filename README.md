# The Pressure-Time Field (PTF) – A Theory of Time and Structure

## Author
David Rømer Voigt  
In collaboration with AI Assistant "Jarvis"

## Project Description
This project presents a unified physical model where **time, structure, and resonance** emerge from a latent field via a spiral tension rupture. The theory introduces a pressure-based spiral field function that gives rise to layering, rhythmic expansion, and local time.  

The model bridges cosmology, quantum information, and biological systems, providing a new lens for understanding phenomena ranging from galactic rotation curves to DNA resonance patterns.

## Repository Content
- `ptf_full_document.tex`: Full scientific LaTeX version of the Pressure-Time Field theory.
- `ptf_full_document.pdf`: Compiled PDF version.
- `images/`: Folder with relevant images (spiral structure, simulations, rotation curves, etc.).
- `ptf_short_summary.tex`: Condensed version (6–10 pages) suitable for AI model sharing.
- `ptf_short_summary.pdf`: Compiled version of the summary.
- `README.md`: This document.

## Core Concepts
- **Axial Genesis**: The universe begins through a resonance-based spiral rupture in a latent field, not a singularity.
- **Emergent Time**: Time is generated from local spiral motion, not an external dimension.
- **Spiral Wave Function**: 
  \[
  \Psi(t, r) = 2A \cos(kr - \phi) e^{i\omega t}
  \]
  where $A$, $k$, $\omega$, and $\phi$ define amplitude, spatial layering, temporal rhythm, and phase.

## Key Features
- Testable via simulations (galactic curves, DNA, ECG).
- Bridges classical and quantum theories.
- Offers alternatives to dark matter and time as a background dimension.
