## 📘 What is the Pressure-Time Field?

The Pressure-Time Field (PTF) is a new theoretical framework proposing that **time, structure, and information** all emerge from spiral resonance in a latent universal field. Instead of singularities, dark matter, or entropic time, the PTF model explains the universe through a rhythmic pressure field forming layers, structure, and local time steps via resonance.

The core idea:  
> **Time arises when spiral motion displaces balance.**  
> **Structure arises when tension forms layers and counter-pressure.**

## 🔬 What Does PTF Explain?

- **Cosmic structure**: Spiral galaxies, flat rotation curves—without dark matter  
- **Biological systems**: DNA helices, EEG rhythms, protein resonance  
- **Information theory**: Encoding via spiral pressure, emergent local time  
- **Experimental phenomena**: 40 Hz brain activity, EKG, LIGO chirps
