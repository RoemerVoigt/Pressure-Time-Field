## 🔬 What is the Pressure-Time Field?

The **Pressure-Time Field (PTF)** is a proposed physical model that reconceptualizes space, time, and motion as emergent phenomena from an underlying oscillating pressure field.  
It introduces new mechanisms such as:

- **Axial Time** (time as rotation and resonance, not linear flow)  
- **Spiral Structure Formation**  
- **Dual Spin Fields and Resonant Realization**  
- **Unified explanations** across quantum, relativistic, and biological systems

The PTF framework builds a mathematical structure capable of describing gravitational redshift, field collapse, biological noise, and the emergence of matter.
